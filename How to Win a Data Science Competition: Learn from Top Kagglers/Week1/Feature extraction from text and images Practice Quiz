1.Question 1
TF-IDF is applied to a matrix where each column represents a word, each row represents a document, 
and each value shows the number of times a particular word occurred in a particular document. Choose the correct statements.

+ IDF scales features inversely proportionally to a number of word occurrences over documents:
Purpose of IDF is to decrease importance of most frequent words.

+ TF normalizes sum of the row values to 1 :


2.Question 2
What of these methods can be used to preprocess texts?

+ Lemmatization :
Lemmatization is used to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.

+ Lowercase transformation :
Lowercase is used to unite words written in UPPERCASE and lowercase.

+ Stopwords removal :
After feature generation stopwords result in useless features that interfere with useful ones.

+ Stemming :
Stemming is used to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.


3.Question 3
What is the main purpose of Lemmatization and Stemming?

+ To reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.
this is the exact purpose of Lemmatization and Stemming!
